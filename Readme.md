# Facial landmark Detection with OpenCV



## Project Objective
This repository contains a Python script that uses `dlib` and `OpenCV` for facial detection in images. Once a face is detected, it identifies and visualizes 68 facial landmarks. These landmarks represent various key points on a face, such as the corners of the eyes, the tip of the nose, etc. 

**Features**:
- Detect faces in images.
- Mark 68 facial landmarks on detected faces.
- Visual display of facial landmarks on the original image.

Perfect for applications in facial recognition, emotion detection, and other advanced computer vision tasks.

## Used Libraries

This project requires the following libraries:

- OpenCV
- Dlib
- imutils
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion

Through the two scripts presented, it becomes clear how accessible and effective the construction of a facial landmark detection system is. With the right tools and libraries, it's possible to demystify its complexity and implement it in a simplified manner. 

This ability to identify and mark specific points on the face opens doors to a range of applications, from facial recognition to deeper analyses of expressions and emotions. By mastering these scripts, we can venture into new horizons in computer vision and further explore the potentialities of facial detection.
